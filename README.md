My project seeks to help the coronapandemic situation. At the moment the pandemic has reached a all time high in my country, Sweden.
I have found that most people are following the guidelines pretty well, however, there is somewhat an exception in small food stores.
In the food stores, there are a lot of people. If one of them are sick, there is a chance that more people will catch the virus and help it spread.
My project is quite simple:
    1. sick people put up jobs when they are sick under "ask for help"
    2. Healthy people can search for jobs under "find jobs" (only in their proximity)
    3. When accepting a job, the users can message eachother
    4. The user that accepted can see his/hers jobs under "current jobs" (with a fancy map)

All in all, the project is quite easy. But I am convinced that it would make a difference if everyone in my proximity used it well.
